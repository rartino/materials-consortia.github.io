# About us

Designing new materials suitable for specific applications is a long,
complex, and costly process. Researchers think of new ideas based on
intuition and experience. Their synthesis and evaluation require a
tremendous amount of trial and error. In the last few years, there has
been a major game change in materials design. Thanks to the exponential
growth of computer power and the development of robust first-principles
electronic structure codes, it has become possible to perform large sets
of calculations automatically. This is the burgeoning area of
high-throughput ab initio computation. Such calculations have been used
to create large databases containing the calculated properties of
existing and hypothetical materials, many of which have appeared online:

- [the AFLOW distributed materials property repository](http://aflowlib.org/)
- [the Harvard Clean Energy Project Database](http://molecularspace.org/)
- [the Materials Cloud](http://materialscloud.org/)
- [the Materials Project](http://materialsproject.org/)
- [the NoMaD (Novel Materials Discovery) Repository](http://nomad-repository.eu/)
- [the Open Quantum Materials Database](http://oqmd.org/)
- [the Computational Materials Repository](http://cmr.fysik.dtu.dk/)
- [the Data Catalyst Genome](http://suncat.stanford.edu/)
- [the Materials Platform for Data Science](http://mpds.io/)

The **Open Databases Integration for Materials Design** (OPTIMADE) consortium
aims to make materials databases interoperational by developing a common REST API.
